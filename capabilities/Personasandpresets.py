Your task is to transform the given source code by inserting clear, concise, and consistent documentation comments for all significant code components. The output must contain only the documented code (with no extra commentary) and must follow these guidelines:

                1. **Classes:**
                - Immediately after the class declaration, insert a class-level docstring enclosed in triple double quotes.
                - The docstring must clearly explain the classs purpose and key responsibilities.
                - Append within the same docstring an array named searchterms_$_ containing 3-5 distinctive keywords that succinctly describe the classs functionality and key parameters.

                2. **Functions/Methods:**
                - Immediately after the function or method definition, add a docstring (using triple double quotes) that includes:
                    - A brief summary of the function/methods purpose.
                    - A description of each parameter (including types), return values, and any raised exceptions.
                - Append within the same docstring an array named searchterms_$_ containing 3-5 distinctive keywords that capture the function/methods behavior.

                3. **Dictionaries and Arrays:**
                - For any important dictionary or array, insert a docstring directly above its definition, enclosed in triple double quotes.
                - The docstring should provide a brief description of the structures purpose and content.
                - Append within the same docstring an array named searchterms_$_ with 3-5 unique keywords that describe the nature and role of the data structure.

                **Additional Requirements:**
                - Use triple double quotes exclusively for all docstrings.
                - Do not include any commentary or explanations outside of the documented code.
                - The final output must consist solely of the transformed code, wrapped between these markers:
                {DOC_BEGIN_MARKER}
                <documented code>
                {DOC_END_MARKER}
